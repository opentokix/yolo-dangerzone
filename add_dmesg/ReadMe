This is a tiny linux kernel module that will add a timestamp to your dmesg, so you will 
quickly see when stuff happened, before and after your mark. 

Very easy, very dirty - but sometimes useful

Prereq on debuntu: 
apt-get install build-essential 

Compile: 
make 

Usage:
sudo insmod add_mark_to_dmesg.ko && sudo rmmod add_mark_to_dmesg

You will get the following line your dmesg output: 

Example: 
[8927419.128178] -- MARK -- Added manually at: 2015-01-13 13:00:06
